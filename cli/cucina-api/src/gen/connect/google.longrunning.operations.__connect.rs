/// Generic over `T: ClientTransport`. For **gRPC** (HTTP/2), use
/// `Http2Connection` — it has honest `poll_ready` and composes with
/// `tower::balance` for multi-connection load balancing. For **Connect
/// over HTTP/1.1** (or unknown protocol), use `HttpClient`.
///
/// # Example (gRPC / HTTP/2)
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use connectrpc::client::{Http2Connection, ClientConfig};
/// use connectrpc::Protocol;
///
/// let uri: http::Uri = "http://localhost:8080".parse()?;
/// let conn = Http2Connection::connect_plaintext(uri.clone()).await?.shared(1024);
/// let config = ClientConfig::new(uri).with_protocol(Protocol::Grpc);
///
/// let client = OperationsClient::new(conn, config);
/// let response = client.list_operations(request).await?;
/// ```
///
/// # Example (Connect / HTTP/1.1 or ALPN)
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use connectrpc::client::{HttpClient, ClientConfig};
///
/// let http = HttpClient::plaintext();  // cleartext http:// only
/// let config = ClientConfig::new("http://localhost:8080".parse()?);
///
/// let client = OperationsClient::new(http, config);
/// let response = client.list_operations(request).await?;
/// ```
///
/// # Working with the response
///
/// Unary calls return [`UnaryResponse<OwnedView<FooView>>`](::connectrpc::client::UnaryResponse).
/// [`view()`](::connectrpc::client::UnaryResponse::view) borrows the response
/// message, so field access is zero-copy:
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let resp = client.list_operations(request).await?;
/// let name: &str = resp.view().name;  // borrow into the response buffer
/// ```
///
/// If you need the owned struct (e.g. to store or pass by value), use
/// [`into_owned()`](::connectrpc::client::UnaryResponse::into_owned):
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// let owned = client.list_operations(request).await?.into_owned();
/// ```
///
/// [`into_view()`](::connectrpc::client::UnaryResponse::into_view) keeps the
/// zero-copy decoded body (an `OwnedView`) without copying; field access on it
/// goes through `.reborrow()`. Streaming responses yield one
/// [`StreamMessage`](::connectrpc::StreamMessage) per received message from
/// `.message().await` — read fields zero-copy through the generated accessor
/// methods (`msg.name()`) or `.view()`, or convert with `.to_owned_message()`.
